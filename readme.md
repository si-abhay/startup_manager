ðŸš©1. We have complete working Login/Logout Signup system with all working forgot password emails and reset password emails working in real time and actual mails being sent.

ðŸš©2. Once the startup is verified we redirect it to the profilepage where they can find all the necesarry details regarding the further processes. 

ðŸš©3. As startups user may need guidance, so we have implemented a chatbot which will automate the process of taking users query and providind solutions.

ðŸš©4.One super admin will have all the control of the backend stuff. We have used django on the backend, so the password entered by the users will not be visible to the admin, passwords will be hashed by SHA-256 Algorithm and also salting will be applied. Thats a plus point taking users security and privacy in consideration.

ðŸš©5. We have also implemented a blog system where users who are investor can mention the important stuffs in the form of blogs so that startups can benefit. 
1. The blogs can be searched by keywords if that exist in blog title or blog content.
2. The blogs can also be shown by only of specific tags and category.
3. The blogs page have Pagination to allow only 4 posts per page.
4. Also on sidebar a field to show the latest 2 blog posts.

ðŸš©6.We have also implemented different filters and export in diff formats like excel,csv,pdf etc, to export the list of the fields of database in admin panel with context to applied filters.
ðŸš©7.There is also a grievance addressal system to allow users to submit their grievances regarding the registered startups on startup manager. Which is stored in database and can be filtered by startup name or other fields. So as to get an idea which startup is not working fine.

ðŸš©8.On the website there is a contact us form on homepage at the bottom, when filled by any random site visitor or user it automatically sends a mail to admin email with the data of the form.

ðŸš©9. Startups can also seek help in terms of resources, which after proper verification will be provided by College Authorities, the admin can accept or reject a request and if he/she wants can also add a feedback for accepting or rejecting which is displayed on user profile. If there are any on going goverment schemes for the startup Startup Manager will notify the startups by creating a blog post regarding that.

### FURTHER STEPS
-To redefine admin panel views using custom views
-implemented the startup dashboard where they can show their quarterly progress by uploading a csv. Which will be visible to Admin and the investors using charts.
-To work on single blogpost page view
-To allow users to be able to comment on blogs
