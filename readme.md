ðŸš©1. We have implemented the User Login and authentication system using the Google API. Where all the details required by by GUSEC have been taken care of. Users will be asked all the questions as mentioned by the GUSEC.

ðŸš©2. Once the startup is verified we redirect it to the application homepage where they can find all the necesaary details regarding the further processes. 

ðŸš©3. As startup mentioned in their session that they provide the guidance manually, so we have implemented a chatbot which will automate the process of taking users query and providind solutions.

ðŸš©4.One super admin will have all the control of the backend stuff. aWe have used django on the backend, so the password entered by the users will not be visible by the admin, passwords will be hashed. Thats a plus point taking users security and privacy in consideration.

ðŸš©5. We have also implemented a blog system where GUSEC can mention the important stuffs in the form of blogs so that startups can benefit.

ðŸš©6.We have also implemented the startup dashboard where they can show their quarterly progress. Which will be visible to GUSEC and the investors.

ðŸš©7. Startups can also seek help in terms of resources, which after proper verification will be provided by GUSEC. If there are any on going goverment schemes for the startup GUSEC will notify the startups regarding that.
